# Clean Architecture Android Sample

I've been reading about differents architectures for software development and Android. One of this was the 'clean code concepts' and SOLID from Uncle Bob. Personally, was a little difficult to understand at the beggining because new concepts were introduced to me such as Reactive Programming, Modularization, etc. But after a lots of reads, tutorials and talks, I decided to create this example with things I've learn the last 2 days (and using Kotlin!).

Hope you can take this basic sample to learn.
